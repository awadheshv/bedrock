# CITYTECH, Inc. CQ Library

[CITYTECH, Inc.](http://www.citytechinc.com)

## Overview

The CITYTECH CQ Library contains common utilities, decorators, abstract classes, tag libraries, and JavaScript modules for bootstrapping and simplifying Adobe CQ5 implementations.

## User Guide

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Citytechinc/cq-library/wiki) for details.

## Versioning

Follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

Previous releases had the CQ version number appended to the library version, e.g. "2.0.0-cq-5.4.0".  Going forward, the CQ version number will be omitted in favor of a simplified scheme using the above guidelines.  A new version of CQ would introduce dependency version changes and possibly backwards incompatibility, which would correspond to a major version increment.  Absent other significant library API changes, only minor and patch version changes would apply for a single version of CQ.
