The JavaScript libraries included in this module are not explicitly embedded when including the "bedrock.utilities"
client library due to the likelihood that client CQ projects will want to define specific versions of these dependencies
(jQuery, etc) without being bound to the versions included here.  Client projects will be required to either include
this "bedrock.dependencies" category or define their own versions of these libraries before including the
"bedrock.utilities" category.
