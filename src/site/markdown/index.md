## Overview

The CITYTECH CQ Library contains common utilities, decorators, abstract classes, tag libraries, and JavaScript modules for bootstrapping and simplifying Adobe AEM (CQ5) implementations.

## Goals

* Accelerate project development by defining a simple process for implementing the underlying component logic.
* Eliminate all Java scriptlets from component JSPs.
* Ensure a consistent structure and implementation pattern for all component classes.
* Isolate CQ-specific concerns (accessing the JCR, adapting Sling and CQ objects, building links) into common modules.
* Achieve a high level of code reuse both within and across CQ projects.
