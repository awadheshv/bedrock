New projects should use the [CITYTECH CQ5 Maven Archetype](https://github.com/Citytechinc/cq5-archetype) rather than including the library manually as outlined below.  The details are provided here for reference.

Define the CQ Library as the parent of a Maven project to inherit dependency and plugin management.

    <parent>
        <groupId>com.citytechinc.cq.library</groupId>
        <artifactId>cq-library</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </parent>

The including project's Core module POM must also include the CQ Library Core module as a compile-scoped dependency.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.citytechinc.cq.library</groupId>
            <artifactId>cq-library-core</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Additionally, the project's UI module POM must include the CQ Library UI dependency.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.citytechinc.cq.library</groupId>
            <artifactId>cq-library-ui</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <type>zip</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

The UI dependency is used by the Maven Assembly Plugin to include the CQ Library zip artifact in the package created by the including project's build process.

The project's assembly descriptor (typically src/main/assembly/zip.xml in the UI module) must define a dependency set to include and unpack the CQ Library UI artifact.

    <dependencySets>
        ...
        <dependencySet>
            <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
            <useProjectArtifact>false</useProjectArtifact>
            <scope>compile</scope>
            <includes>
                <include>com.citytechinc.cq.library:cq-library-ui:zip</include>
            </includes>
            <unpack>true</unpack>
            <unpackOptions>
                <includes>
                    <include>jcr_root/apps/cq-library/**/*</include>
                    <include>jcr_root/etc/clientlibs/cq-library/**/*</include>
                </includes>
            </unpackOptions>
            <useStrictFiltering>true</useStrictFiltering>
        </dependencySet>
    </dependencySets>

Including the CQ Library in this manner eliminates the need to build and install the CQ Library package separately and/or activate additional Maven profiles.
