$symbol_pound$symbol_pound Including in Client Projects

New projects should use the [CITYTECH CQ Maven Archetype](https://github.com/Citytechinc/cq-archetype) rather than including the library manually as outlined below.  The details are provided here for reference.

Define Bedrock as the parent of a Maven project to inherit dependency and plugin management.

    <parent>
        <groupId>com.citytechinc.aem.bedrock</groupId>
        <artifactId>bedrock</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </parent>

The including project's Core module POM must also include the Bedrock API and Core modules as a compile-scoped dependency.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.citytechinc.aem.bedrock</groupId>
            <artifactId>bedrock-api</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.citytechinc.aem.bedrock</groupId>
            <artifactId>bedrock-core</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Additionally, the project's UI module POM must include the Bedrock UI dependency.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.citytechinc.aem.bedrock</groupId>
            <artifactId>bedrock-ui</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <type>zip</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

The UI dependency is used by the Maven Assembly Plugin to include the Bedrock zip artifact in the package created by the including project's build process.

The project's assembly descriptor (typically src/main/assembly/zip.xml in the UI module) must define a dependency set to include and unpack the Bedrock UI artifact.

    <dependencySets>
        ...
        <dependencySet>
            <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
            <useProjectArtifact>false</useProjectArtifact>
            <scope>compile</scope>
            <includes>
                <include>com.citytechinc.aem.bedrock:bedrock-ui:zip</include>
            </includes>
            <unpack>true</unpack>
            <unpackOptions>
                <includes>
                    <include>jcr_root/apps/bedrock/**/*</include>
                    <include>jcr_root/etc/clientlibs/bedrock/**/*</include>
                </includes>
            </unpackOptions>
            <useStrictFiltering>true</useStrictFiltering>
        </dependencySet>
    </dependencySets>

Including Bedrock in this manner eliminates the need to build and install the project package separately and/or activate additional Maven profiles.
