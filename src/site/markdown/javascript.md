`MultiCompositeField` and [`SuperBoxSelect`](http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?69307-3.x-Ext.ux.form.SuperBoxSelect) widgets are automatically included for use in author mode when the Bedrock package is installed.

### Utilities

Bedrock utility functions can be included in a client project using the `<cq:includeClientLib/>` tag.

    <cq:includeClientLib js="citytech.utilities"/>

Documentation for the available utility functions can be found in the JSDocs on the project site.
